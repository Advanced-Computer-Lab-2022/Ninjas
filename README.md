# Courses Planet

Courses Planet is an online learning system that aims to fulfill the educational needs of learners around the globe by connecting them to several skilled instructors who are able to teach a variety of courses. The creators of the website aim to fulfill the requirements of all instructors and trainees in one combined system.

## Motivation

Since the start of COVID19 crisis, a significant spike in demand of online learning platforms has been generated. As a result, the countless benefits of online learning have been observed (efficient learning, management flexibility, easy accessibility, etc.).
Online learning websites indeed allow the future generations to access the best education possible around the globe. Based on this fact, the developers of this project decided to implement the idea, for the sake of the future.

## Features

1. Write notes while watching video :writing_hand:
  Why use a pen and a paper when you can type down your notes and download them as a PDF file? In Courses Planet, you can drop down lines of code while watching the video at the same time! It's completely up to you to choose whether you want to download the notes or not afterwards.

2. Pay using a credit card OR your wallet :credit_card: :dollar:
  Do you want to use your course refund to register in another course? We got you covered! Our system allows the trainees to pay for course registeration using their credit cards or the balance in their wallet.

3. Edit or delete their rating on a specific course or instructor :star: :star: :star:
  In case you change your mind after rating a course/instructor, the website permits you to edit your rating or delete it if needed.

4. Retake a failed exercise :memo:
  Life is full of second chances. If you failed an exercise, Courses Planet will allow you to retake it over and over again, until your grade is over 50% of the total grade of that exercise. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone. :slightly_smiling_face:

5. View the grade of a previously solved exercise :books:
  You can always come back later to recheck your latest grade in an exercise you have solved in the past. Just go to the course page, open the subtitle, and the grade will show up for you.

6. See the total number of enrolled students in a course at this very moment :busts_in_silhouette:
  Wondering how popular the course is? Go to its page to see the number of enrolled students.

7. Instructors can see the average grade scored in their course exercises :chart_with_upwards_trend:
  Sometimes instructors want to know whether the exercise they added to a subtitle is too hard, or way too easy. To help them decide, we always display the average grade scored in an exercise.
